# CS120B-Final-Project--LED-Tower-Defense
LED Tower Defense was my final project for my CS120B Intro to Embedded Systems class. I coded my project using Atmel Studio 7(C++) and the Arduino IDE(C). The Atmel Studio code was uploaded to my ATMega1284 microcontroller and the Arduino IDE code was uploaded to my Arduino Uno.
The code on the ATMega1284 dealt with the game logic, LCD display, user input, cursor movement and communication with the Arduino Uno.
The code on the Arduino Uno dealt with the LEDs on the 16x32 LED Matrix and communication with the ATmega1284.
